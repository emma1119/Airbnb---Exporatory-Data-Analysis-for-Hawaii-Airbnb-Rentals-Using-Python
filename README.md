Airbnb - Isolation Forest - Outlier Detection for Airbnb Rentals in Hawaii.ipynb

Build an outlier Detection model using Isolation Forest to identify anomalies withing the rental listings .
Isolation forest is a relatively new Machine learning technilogy for outlier detection. It is a tree based model where the anomaly is dected by how many partitions does it take to isolate from the rest of the population based on random features and take the average. 
In this excercise, it is chosen to do an unsupervised model to highligh the outliers which are abnormal listings based on 'price','minimum_nights','availability_365'.
